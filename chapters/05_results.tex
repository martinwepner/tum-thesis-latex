\chapter{Results}\label{chapter:results}

In this chapter I present how my CUDA solution compares against the TensorFlow implementations of $\Phi_{Flow}$.
\par All benchmarks were performed in a closed boundary environment with random divergence vectors in the $\left[-1, 1 \right]$ range. This does not represent real fluid simulations. However, as a benchmark it is well suited to compare the individual implementations. 
\par The targeted residual accuracy was $1^{-5}$. Before starting the measurement, a warm-up of 5 runs was performed. The data shows the mean and standard deviation of 25 runs. The test system consists of a GeForce GTX 980, a Quad-Core Intel Core i7 3779K @3.5GHz CPU and 8GB of RAM. Because of memory limitations on the test system, some tests could not be done in the $\Phi_{Flow}$ implementations.
\subsubsection{Performance Pressure Solve}
The following table shows the execution time per solve and the average number of cg-iterations for quadratic grids and compares the TensorFlow solutions with my CUDA implementation: \\\\

\end{figure*}
In this test, I compare how much my GPU solution differs from the CPU version of $\Phi_{Flow}$. I have calculated the absolute and relative difference between the pressure vectors component-wise. As stated in Fig. \ref{fig:error}, the error is sufficiently small.

\subsubsection{Performance Laplace Matrix generation}
The speed of the Laplace matrix generation is crucial for simulation with moving boundary conditions. $\Phi_{Flow}$ calculates the Laplace matrix once at startup on the CPU, so it has no effect on the actual fluid simulation. Compared to the CPU implementation I could shorten the generation time up to 800 times.  While the CPU version scales with the simulation size, my parallel CUDA implementation remains constant for significantly longer.
