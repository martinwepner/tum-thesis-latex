\chapter{CUDA Pressure Solver}\label{chapter:cudapressuresolver}
In this chapter we find an efficient numerical approach to solve the system of linear equations $\mathbf{A}p = -\frac{\rho \Delta x^2}{\Delta t}\nabla \cdot \vec{u}^n$ using TensorFlows Custom Kernels and Nvidia CUDA. First, we discuss how $\mathbf{A}$ is built and stored in memory and then how the Conjugate Gradient method can be used to solve it.
