In this thesis I presented an efficient implementation for the pressure solver. I introduced the Tailored CSR format that allows the Laplace Matrix to be created efficiently on the GPU with little memory used. This allows the matrix multiplication in the cg-method to be calculated faster than conventional methods. The highly optimized cuBLAS library can execute all other mathematical operations efficiently on the GPU.\\
\par I was able to improve the speed by a factor of up to 139 compared to the CPU version and by a factor of up to 72 compared to the $\Phi_{flow}$ TensorFlow GPU implementation. This will help to speed up the training process \\
\par Because the main focus of this work was the acceleration of the pressure solver, there is still potential to improve the Laplace matrix generation kernel. In addition, there are certainly possibilities to further optimize memory access in the cg algorithm.
